Fluid resuscitation is a critical component in the management of sick children presenting with acute infections and sepsis. It aims to restore an effective circulating volume, avoiding progression to shock, which can impair end organ perfusion and increase mortality. Fluid administration protocols were established to guide care effectively, some of these commonly used protocols are the Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) and  European Paediatric Life Support (EPLS) in resource-rich settings. 

In resource limited settings, the WHO established fluid administration guidance when intensive care facilities are not available as a part of the Emergency Triage Assessment and Treatment (ETAT) guidelines. One of the most recently updated guidelines in management of sepsis in children was established by the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM); it offers some guidance in both resource-limited and resource-rich settings and recommendations on blood transfusion goals. 

The above guidelines provide strategies on initial fluid administration through a rapid infusion (bolus), however none offer substantial recommendations on optimal maintenance fluid strategies prior to the progression to shock, different types of fluid preparations, or the role of blood transfusion in non-hemorrhagic shock states. Since the publication of these guidelines, there has been recent evidence comparing different types of intravenous fluids, as well as blood product transfusion in septic shock8.    

The objective of this work is to conduct a systematic literature review to synthesize evidence on fluid resuscitation strategies in children with febrile illness prior to shock development, when shock has occurred, as well as evaluate the role of blood product transfusion in non-hemorrhagic shock. This work will inform the WHO guidelines on fluid management in children presenting with a febrile illness. 

PICO Questions

1. In infants and children aged 2-months to 12 years presenting with an acute infection and no
dehydration or circulatory impairment, what is the appropriate fluid maintenance strategy if they are unable to take fluids orally/enterally?

2. In infants and children aged 2-months to 12 years with circulatory impairment (without shock),
what is the optimal fluid strategy during the first 48 hours to restore haemodynamic stability and
improve survival?

3. In infants and children aged 2-months to 12 years with non-hemorrhagic shock, what is the
optimal fluid strategy to improve survival and restore haemodynamic stability?

4. In infants and children aged 2-months to 12 years with shock (not due to trauma or blood loss), can the use of a blood transfusion reduce mortality?
