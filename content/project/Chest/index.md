We are developing the new American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guideline on management of pneumothorax. The aim of this guideline is to provide recommendations on the methods of pleural space drainage, size of chest tube used, type of pleurodesis when needed, and the use of endobronchial valves with persistent air leak.
