abstract: Background:  There is evidence that physicians’ prescription behavior is
  negatively affected by the extent of their interactions with pharmaceutical companies.
  In order to develop and implement policies and interventions for better management
  of interactions, we need to understand physicians’ perspectives on this issue. Surveys
  addressing physi‑cians’ interactions with pharmaceutical companies need to use validated
  tools to ensure the validity of their findings. Objective:  To assess the validity
  of tools used in surveys of physicians about the extent and nature of their interac‑tions
  with pharmaceutical companies, and about their knowledge, beliefs and attitudes
  towards such interactions; and to identify those tools that have been formally validated.
  Methods:  We developed a search strategy with the assistance of a medical librarian.
  We electronically searched MED‑LINE and EMBASE databases in September 2015. Teams
  of two reviewers conducted data selection and data abstrac‑tion. They identified
  eligible studies in one table and then abstracted the relevant data from the studies
  with validated tools in another table. Tables were piloted and standardized. Results: 
  We identified one validated questionnaire out of the 11 assessing the nature and
  extent of the interaction, and three validated questionnaires out of the 47 assessing
  knowledge, beliefs and attitudes of physicians toward the interaction. None of these
  validated questionnaires were used in more than one survey. Conclusion:  The available
  supporting evidence of the issue of physicians’ interaction with pharmaceutical
  company is of low quality. There is a need for research to develop and validate
  tools to survey physicians about their interac‑tions with pharmaceutical companies.
