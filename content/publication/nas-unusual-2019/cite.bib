 abstract = {Introduction: Totally implantable venous access devices are used extensively worldwide in cancer patients for administration of venotoxic agents, blood sampling, and nutrition. Their tip is usually positioned at the junction of superior vena cava and right atrium. Inferior vena cava filters are usually used for deep venous thrombosis in cases where anticoagulation is contraindicated; they can be inserted either via internal jugular or femoral access depending on patient conditions and preference.},
