abstract: 'Introduction: Totally implantable venous access devices are used extensively
  worldwide in cancer patients for administration of venotoxic agents, blood sampling,
  and nutrition. Their tip is usually positioned at the junction of superior vena
  cava and right atrium. Inferior vena cava filters are usually used for deep venous
  thrombosis in cases where anticoagulation is contraindicated; they can be inserted
  either via internal jugular or femoral access depending on patient conditions and
  preference.'
