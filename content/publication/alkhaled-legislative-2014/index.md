abstract: 'Background: Pharmaceutical company representatives likely influence the
  prescribing habits and professional behaviour of physicians. Objective: The objective
  of this study was to systematically review the effects of interventions targeting
  practising physicians’ interactions with pharmaceutical companies. Eligibility criteria:
  We included observational studies, non-randomised controlled trials (non-RCTs) and
  RCTs evaluating legislative, educational, policy or other interventions targeting
  the interactions between physicians and pharmaceutical companies. Data sources:
  The search strategy included an electronic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE. Two reviewers
  performed duplicate and independent study selection, data abstraction and assessment
  of risk of bias. Appraisal and synthesis methods: We assessed the risk of bias in
  each included study. We summarised the findings narratively because the nature of
  the data did not allow a meta-analysis to be conducted. We assessed the quality
  of evidence by outcome using the GRADE methodology. Results: Of 11 189 identified
  citations, one RCT and three observational studies met the eligibility criteria.
  All four studies specifically targeted one type of interaction with pharmaceutical
  companies, that is, interactions with drug representatives. The RCT provided moderate
  quality evidence of no effect of a ‘collaborative approach’ between the pharmaceutical
  industry and a health authority. The three observational studies provided low quality
  evidence suggesting a positive effect of policies aiming to reduce interaction between
  physicians and pharmaceutical companies (by restricting free samples, promotional
  material, and meetings with pharmaceutical company representatives) on prescription
  behaviour. Limitations: We identified too few studies to allow strong conclusions.
  Conclusions: Available evidence suggests a potential impact of policies aiming to
  reduce interaction between physicians and drug representatives on physicians’ prescription
  behaviour. We found no evidence concerning interventions affecting other types of
  interaction with pharmaceutical companies.'
