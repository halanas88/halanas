abstract: "Background: Screening colonoscopy aims to interrupt the adenoma-carcinoma
  sequence by removing all precancerous adenomatous polyps. Adenomatous polyp detection
  rate (ADR) can vary between endoscopists as well as between race, age, and risk
  of colorectal cancer (CRC). The purpose of this study was to compare ADR among academic
  gastroenterologists (A-GI), non-A-GI, and surgeons for endoscopies performed in
  the same endoscopic suite of a large medical center with a predominately African
  American (AA) population. Methods: All screening colonoscopies performed in 2014
  for patients aged 62-76 years were identified using the electronic medical records
  data. Patients with average risk and high risk of CRC defined as having a 'personal
  history of polyps' or 'family history of CRC', and history of ulcerative colitis
  and Fecal Occult Blood Test/Fecal Immunochemical Test (FOBT/FIT) positivity were
  included. Patients with incomplete colonoscopy (defined as failing to achieve cecal
  intubation or poor preparation) and unrecovered tissue biopsy were excluded. ADR
  was calculated for three groups of endoscopists: A-GIs, non-A-GIs, and surgeons.

  was analyzed. The endoscopists comprised five A-GIs, eight non-A-GIs, and six surgeons.
  The majority of patients were of AA decent (71%), female (54%) with an average age
  of 66 years. Patients classified as average risk comprised 79% of the population.
  Most of the colonoscopies were performed by A-GI (n=339), followed by nonA-GI (n=144),
  and surgeons (n=90). The ADR for A-GI was 50% as compared to 32% for non-AGI (ptextless0.001)
  and 25% for surgeons (ptextless0.001). Also, A-GI were more likely to identify ≥3
  adenomas during screening colonoscopies. Significant differences were observed (ptextless0.001)
  in the mean time of colonoscopy for A-GI (30 mins) non-A-G (14 mins), and surgeons
  (18 mins). Conclusion: Significant variation in the ADR between endoscopists belonging
  to different specialties were observed. Although all appear to achieve acceptable
  ADR (ie at least 25 for men and 15 for women), academic gastroenterologists had
  better performance than non-academic GI and surgeons. This may be explained by a
  significantly longer average duration of procedures for the highest ADR group."
