Gentle reader, I hope you are doing well!
It’s been a while since I scribbled; if you could tell…
I thought after being a seasoned old fellow 
I could impart on you some wisdom, the years have made me mellow 

Rule number one of bravery, is to know when to run 
What’s better than being dead, is living to have more fun!
When suspecting  a ghost in your bathroom don’t pull the shower curtain 
Run for the hills even if you’re not certain 

Rule number two is to never own a freaky doll
No Billy, no Chucky; don’t take Annabelle on a stroll 
Fill your bed if you must with squishy teddy bears
No doll is out to off you, and replay your worst fears 

And the third rule is to never open a fishy box 
Especially one that has many locks 
You never know what could lie in its heart
A ghost, a ghoul, or a body part!

Fourth is to never go explore a noise when electricity is out 
Gently sneak out of your place, and start to shout 
For there will always be an entity behind your back 
And you will be bound to end in a bloody attack

And fifth is to never trust a clown
If you see it in the sewers, leave the town! 
For it’s mischievous spirit cannot hide behind blowing bubbles 
And Its sneaky ways will land you in trouble

Sixth is to never wander into an abandoned house 
You should fly out when you don’t even see a mouse 
Because you might never find your way out 
Secret passages and doors will fill you with doubt

Seventh and last is to never be obsessed with your time of death 
Leave this to the doctor, they’ll pronounce it when you take your last breath 
No apps, no videos that will give you seven days 
Don’t watch Final Destination that have you die in five hundred ways 

Dearest reader, I hope these rules offer some education
If you are a horror movie junkie with a wild imagination 
When your senses trick you and fear is what you feel
Remember the golden rule, nothing is real!
