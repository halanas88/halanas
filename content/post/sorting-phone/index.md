Oh you might not be the rhyming kind 
But don’t judge on what you see
I’ll intubate myself if you can find 
A rhyme-hungry fellow like me 

You may keep your pagers on
And pretend to assess a case  
But when you get called by the triage phone 
Then turfing arts take place 

There’s nothing hidden out and about
That Doc McNas can’t see
So read my verses and find out
In which unit you ought to be  

You might belong in CICU 
Where all that matters is heart 
If there’s a respiratory failure that’s new
They’re masters at the turfing art

You might belong in MICU 
Where they carry the weight of the world
Those are fellows you’d want to run into
But at neuro turfs, their lips are curled 

Or yet in lofty loud NICU 
If you like an endless round 
Or refusing status epilepitcus admissions too
Because the WBC is slightly above the ground

Or perhaps in SICU
You’ll find trauma that blows your brain
Their fondness for albumin is true 
In patients with an abdominal drain  

So go on then and read these tweets 
And choose where you belong 
I promise your answer will be discrete 
Let’s have some fun with this song!
