One of the most relatable chapters in Jeff's book was **Career Planning**. While his advice was mainly geared towards graduate studnets in science and post docs, I believe that many aspects of that advice can also be helpful to young physicians finishing their training and starting to build their careers as independent physicians. I couldn't help but agree with his observation that if you're seeking payment for a job, it's likely that certain aspects of that role will contribute to your career development.

We go into the fields of medicine and science drawn by the fascination and thrill of unraveling the mysteries of how things operate. Simply excelling in scientific prowess isn't sufficient; it's crucial to also focus on and meticulously strategize one's career path, and having a well-thought-out career plan can help navigate the opportunities and challenges that arise in one's career effectively.

One of the biggest hurdles is usually knowing what type of career someone is looking to go. While graduate students generally seek roles like tenure track faculty, liberal arts college professor, research track faculty, and industry positions, medical positions are not too different. A physician in training could seek a career as a physician scientist, with at least 70% of their time devoted to research and grant application with minimal academic responsibility, another option leading to the former role is physician scholar. Someone would become a master clinical, a physician educator or collaborate with drug and device industry. 
Understanding what aspects of a career appeal to someone is crucial for delving into additional opportunities.

Jeff asks his readers to consider "who they are" and what story is their CV trying to tell. He further encourages us to consider our strengths in a certain field, the roads we have taken to align our path with the career path that we are seeking, and the mentors that would advocate for us to be in the posfessional enviroment we aspire to. 

Teaching classes, posting teaching materials and recording lectures can showcase someone's teaching skills. Experiencing a sense of pride and fulfillment comes from nurturing another person's growth and imparting knowledge that proves valuable throughout their lifetime. There are always opportunities that young faculty could seek to further sharpen their teaching skills as well, such as volunteering to teach when possible, and even participating in educational workshops at national conferences. 

Networking aids in building a reputation and highlighting your abilities beyond your home institution. I find it important to identify major conference times, sub-speciality conferences and abstract submission times. Being involved in national committees can expand one's horizon, foster collaboration and possibly, and serve as a catalyst for securing a job or earning a promotion.

Ultimately, the crucial aspect is recognizing that nobody possesses all knowledge. Identifying sources of help is a valuable skill, and every institution offers its own set of resources that can be incredibly useful.
