One of the most relatable chapters in Jeff's book was **Career Planning**. While his advice was mainly geared towards graduate studnets in science and post docs, I believe that many aspects of that advice can also be helpful to young physicians finishing their training and starting to build their careers as independent physicians. I couldn't help but agree with his observation that if you're seeking payment for a job, it's likely that certain aspects of that role will contribute to your career development.

Having a **career plan** is essential. Simply excelling in scientific prowess isn't sufficient; it's crucial to also focus on and meticulously strategize one's career path. We go into the fields of medicine and science drawn by the fascination and thrill of unraveling the mysteries of how things operate.

 having a well-thought-out career plan can help navigate these opportunities and challenges effectively.
