Esteemed reader, let‚Äôs go on a trip down memory lane 
When I was a wee intern... When life was a pain 
You are probably fed up with tales of pulmonary and critical care 
Let‚Äôs talk internal medicine then, it‚Äôs only fair!

One October night when my team was oncall
We got an admission of a man with a fall
This man drank like a fish, and was always passed out 
Relax, it‚Äôs not a liver failure... I can hear your silent shout! 

Mr Hooch was snorting coke and imbibing whiskey till he lost his powers
He was passed out on his back for ten hours 
His wallet in his back pocket, against his fat bun
Brace yourself dear reader, you‚Äôre in for some fun! 

After Mr Hooch woke up from his deep slumber 
An electric pain shot down his leg, 10 out of 10 in number 
He was waddling around trying to ease his pain...
Until passing brown urine scared him out of his brain!

He limped to the emergency department, as his leg started to feel numb 
He was wiggling in discomfort, he felt so dumb 
His glute was getting tight, that wasn‚Äôt a result of the dead-lift üòè
An ER physician got the pleasure of meeting him at the end of the shift

He was swiftly diagnosed with cellulitis of the bun 
Started on vancomycin, our MRSA-wiping gun
To medicine, he was admitted for tender loving care 
He was still feeling burning pain in his derri√®re

A starry-eyed intern did a detailed physical exam
Including a thorough neuro testing, even though nerves weren‚Äôt her jam
His booty looked as normal as booties can be
No tumor, calor, rubor or dolor... This ain‚Äôt cellulitis, don‚Äôt you agree?! 

This man stopped making urine, and his creatinine was rising 
The clue was the dark-colored urine, then the answer wasn‚Äôt surprising 
When checked, his CPK was through the roof
This was rhabdomyolysis, you got your proof!

He was flushed with fluids through the IV
But one liter after the other, Hooch still couldn‚Äôt pee!
CPK was still rising fast, with swelling in the muscle space 
Surgery was called, this was a compartment case!

Poor Hooch! Surgery cut his fascia to relieve the tension 
His neuropathy improved, and his leg was saved from a grim fate 
And he ended up on dialysis because of renal tubular obstruction 
To correct his severe hyperkalemia before it was too late   

Rhabdomyolysis is a case where your muscle fibers break down 
Releasing pigments into blood, causing urine to be brown 
It can be caused by strenuous activity 
Infections, medications and toxins that decrease muscle longevity 

One of the hallmarks is a urine that‚Äôs gone red
When you don‚Äôt see RBCs, think myoglobin instead 
Your diagnosis is made by an elevated CPK
Beware the compartment syndrome when muscles decay 

Flush the patient with fluids, and call nephrology stat 
Get scheduled BMPs to see where your electrolytes are at 
Always keep the compartment syndrome on your mind 
Don‚Äôt forget to check a DIC panel, or you will be behind! 

Ladies and gents, I hope you enjoyed this curious presentation
Of the cellulitis that turned out to be a rhabdo situation!
Always focus on getting a good physical and history 
And you shall crack DocMcNas‚Äô mystery!
