Bonsoir, mes amis, comment allez-vous?
It is time… A new story is due
Quel dommage, what a loss… Summer is almost gone…
I have a new tale that will wipe away that frown!

Once upon a time late in the night
A man got transferred after giving his PCP a fright 
His cancer screening CT required immediate action 
A dense object was causing airway impaction

The man loved his coins dearly 
He would eat dimes and nickels yearly 
He hated quarters, said they tasted bad 
A coin ended in his airway, the poor lad! 

The coin caused a right middle lobe collapse
And a post obstructive pneumonia, perhaps! 
We booked the OR as his oxygen was going low
And he ended up gasping for air on heated high flow

After anesthesia induction, when sedation was deep
We rigid-intubated him after he was fast asleep
When we inspected his airway, we found the lost treasure!
My friends, eating coins never ends up in pleasure!

The coin was firmly wedged in the BI 
We grabbed the locking forceps and gave it a try
We slowly extubated the rigid scope with the nickel
The thought of dropping the coin made our skin prickle 

After this intervention his airway was open again 
He asked for his nickel back and started  to complain
His oxygen went up to normal on room air
And he was walking up and down the stairs

Dearest friends, foreign airway objects are a beast 
You get coins, nuts and foods from a feast
I hope you enjoyed this tale from OR 21 
It’s truly where you have heaps of fun!
