	abstract = {Background:  There is evidence that physicians’ prescription behavior is negatively affected by the extent of their interactions with pharmaceutical companies. In order to develop and implement policies and interventions for better management of interactions, we need to understand physicians’ perspectives on this issue. Surveys addressing physi‑cians’ interactions with pharmaceutical companies need to use validated tools to ensure the validity of their findings.
Objective:  To assess the validity of tools used in surveys of physicians about the extent and nature of their interac‑tions with pharmaceutical companies, and about their knowledge, beliefs and attitudes towards such interactions; and to identify those tools that have been formally validated.
Methods:  We developed a search strategy with the assistance of a medical librarian. We electronically searched MED‑LINE and EMBASE databases in September 2015. Teams of two reviewers conducted data selection and data abstrac‑tion. They identified eligible studies in one table and then abstracted the relevant data from the studies with validated tools in another table. Tables were piloted and standardized.
Results:  We identified one validated questionnaire out of the 11 assessing the nature and extent of the interaction, and three validated questionnaires out of the 47 assessing knowledge, beliefs and attitudes of physicians toward the interaction. None of these validated questionnaires were used in more than one survey.
Conclusion:  The available supporting evidence of the issue of physicians’ interaction with pharmaceutical company is of low quality. There is a need for research to develop and validate tools to survey physicians about their interac‑tions with pharmaceutical companies.},

	abstract = {Background: Pharmaceutical company representatives likely influence the prescribing habits and professional behaviour of physicians.
Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically review the effects of interventions targeting practising physicians’ interactions with pharmaceutical companies. Eligibility criteria: We included observational studies, non-randomised controlled trials (non-RCTs) and RCTs evaluating legislative, educational, policy or other interventions targeting the interactions between physicians and pharmaceutical companies. Data sources: The search strategy included an electronic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE. Two reviewers performed duplicate and independent study selection, data abstraction and assessment of risk of bias. Appraisal and synthesis methods: We assessed the risk of bias in each included study. We summarised the findings narratively because the nature of the data did not allow a meta-analysis to be conducted. We assessed the quality of evidence by outcome using the GRADE methodology.
Results: Of 11 189 identified citations, one RCT and three observational studies met the eligibility criteria. All four studies specifically targeted one type of interaction with pharmaceutical companies, that is, interactions with drug representatives. The RCT provided moderate quality evidence of no effect of a ‘collaborative approach’ between the pharmaceutical industry and a health authority. The three observational studies provided low quality evidence suggesting a positive effect of policies aiming to reduce interaction between physicians and pharmaceutical companies (by restricting free samples, promotional material, and meetings with pharmaceutical company representatives) on prescription behaviour. Limitations: We identified too few studies to allow strong conclusions.
Conclusions: Available evidence suggests a potential impact of policies aiming to reduce interaction between physicians and drug representatives on physicians’ prescription behaviour. We found no evidence concerning interventions affecting other types of interaction with pharmaceutical companies.},

	abstract = {Background: Screening colonoscopy aims to interrupt the adenoma-carcinoma sequence by removing all precancerous adenomatous polyps. Adenomatous polyp detection rate (ADR) can vary between endoscopists as well as between race, age, and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). The purpose of this study was to compare ADR among academic gastroenterologists (A-GI), non-A-GI, and surgeons for endoscopies performed in the same endoscopic suite of a large medical center with a predominately African American (AA) population.
Methods: All screening colonoscopies performed in 2014 for patients aged 62-76 years were identified using the electronic medical records data. Patients with average risk and high risk of CRC defined as having a 'personal history of polyps' or 'family history of CRC', and history of ulcerative colitis and Fecal Occult Blood Test/Fecal Immunochemical Test (FOBT/FIT) positivity were included. Patients with incomplete colonoscopy (defined as failing to achieve cecal intubation or poor preparation) and unrecovered tissue biopsy were excluded. ADR was calculated for three groups of endoscopists: A-GIs, non-A-GIs, and surgeons.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License CC-BY 3.0., which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.
Results: A total of 573 screening colonoscopies was analyzed. The endoscopists comprised five A-GIs, eight non-A-GIs, and six surgeons. The majority of patients were of AA decent (71\%), female (54\%) with an average age of 66 years. Patients classified as average risk comprised 79\% of the population. Most of the colonoscopies were performed by A-GI (n=339), followed by nonA-GI (n=144), and surgeons (n=90). The ADR for A-GI was 50\% as compared to 32\% for non-AGI (p{\textless}0.001) and 25\% for surgeons (p{\textless}0.001). Also, A-GI were more likely to identify ≥3 adenomas during screening colonoscopies. Significant differences were observed (p{\textless}0.001) in the mean time of colonoscopy for A-GI (30 mins) non-A-G (14 mins), and surgeons (18 mins).
Conclusion: Significant variation in the ADR between endoscopists belonging to different specialties were observed. Although all appear to achieve acceptable ADR (ie at least 25 for men and 15 for women), academic gastroenterologists had better performance than non-academic GI and surgeons. This may be explained by a significantly longer average duration of procedures for the highest ADR group.},
